      <!-- ================== Proposition ================== -->
      <h2>Proposition</h2>
      <p><strong>The energy sector is the primary driver of national emissions growth.</strong></p>

      <!-- ================== FOR the proposition ================== -->
      <section>
        <h2>FOR the Proposition</h2>
        <h3>Visualization A — “Energy and Manufacturing Lead Surge in Emissions”</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Energy_Group_Bar.png" alt="Sector-by-year grouped bar chart (2010, 2015, 2020, 2024) highlighting pronounced growth in Energy and Manufacturing." />
          <figcaption>
            A wide, grouped bar chart shows noticeable growth in the Energy sector since 2010 relative to other sectors, visually supporting the claim that Energy drives national emissions growth.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Design decisions &amp; rationale</h3>
        <ul class="decisions">
          <li>
            <span class="score deceptive">-1.0</span>
            <strong>Tight y-limits with minimal padding.</strong>
            Reducing headroom amplifies bar height differences year-over-year, making growth appear more dramatic without clipping data. I considered a full 0-baseline with generous padding, but it made changes look muted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="score earnest">+1.0</span>
            <strong>Consistent sector ordering and grouped bars for 2010→2024.</strong>
            This preserves comparability and reduces scanning load, helping viewers quickly spot the Energy trend. Alternatives like stacked bars obscured year-to-year growth and were very cluttered, reducing readability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="score deceptive">-1.5</span>
            <strong>Emphasis in title and caption.</strong>
            The wording primes the audience to focus on Energy’s rise. A more neutral title would be less persuasive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="score earnest">+1.0</span>
            <strong>Uniform color set by year.</strong>
            Keeping hues constant by year (instead of by sector) makes within-sector growth pop across time. Coloring sectors differently pulled attention sideways across categories instead of forward in time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="score deceptive">-0.5</span>
            <strong>Wide aspect ratio.</strong>
            Stretching horizontally increases separation between year groups and visually enhances upward changes. A squarer plot condenses the graph and reduces the visual difference.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- ================== AGAINST the proposition ================== -->
      <section>
        <h2>AGAINST the Proposition</h2>
        <h3>Visualization B — “Energy’s Share of Total Emissions Has Stayed Consistently Low”</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Energy_vs_Total_Log.png" alt="Grouped bars comparing Total Emissions to Energy Emissions for 2010, 2015, 2020, 2024, drawn on a logarithmic y-axis to keep Energy visually small relative to totals." />
          <figcaption>
            A grouped bar chart with a logarithmic y-axis compares Energy to the national total. Energy remains a small fraction in every year, arguing against the idea that Energy is the primary driver.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Design decisions &amp; rationale</h3>
        <ul class="decisions">
          <li>
            <span class="score deceptive">-1.5</span>
            <strong>Logarithmic y-axis.</strong>
            Log scale compresses the space between large values and stabilizes variation, making Energy look proportionally small. A linear axis made the gap feel smaller and less supportive of our claim.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="score deceptive">-0.5</span>
            <strong>Subdued color for totals; brighter accent for Energy.</strong>
            Paradoxically, the accent draws the eye to small bars, reinforcing that they’re consistently much shorter than totals. A vivid color for totals would dominate attention.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="score earnest">+0.5</span>
            <strong>Side-by-side bars with identical category order.</strong>
            This allows fair comparison across the same years. Alternatives like stacked bars hid absolute differences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="score deceptive">-0.5</span>
            <strong>Calm grid and generous margins.</strong>
            Extra whitespace and light gridlines reduce a sense of volatility. A cramped layout read as “busy” and emphasized fluctuations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="score earnest">+1.0</span>
            <strong>Explicit legend (“Category”).</strong>
            Clear labeling prevents confusion about which bars represent totals versus the subset, reducing accidental misreadings.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- ================== Final Reflection ================== -->
      <section>
        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Designing persuasive visuals for both sides of a single proposition clarified how
          framing, scale, and text steer interpretation even when the underlying data and encodings
          remain reasonable. The “FOR” figure relied on layout and range choices that magnify
          differences over time within a single sector, whereas the “AGAINST” figure leaned on a
          logarithmic scale and calm styling to keep Energy in proportion to the national total.
          Neither graphic fabricates data, but each one definitely encourages a distinct conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most straightforward steps were data transformation and consistent ordering. The
          difficult parts were deciding how far to push scaling and titles without crossing into
          obvious manipulation. I was surprised by how strongly extending and padding axes affected
          perceived growth. Small changes to whitespace can shift the narrative even before
          scaling changes or annotations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I define ethical analysis and visualization as faithfully representing data and
          uncertainty while choosing designs that are relevant to the question and being candid
          about consequential decisions. Acceptable persuasion is a truthful reading of
          the data (e.g., consistent grouping, clear legends, and transparent transformations). What I
          consider “misleading” is when scale choices, filtering, or loaded language intentionally hide
          important information a reasonable viewer would need to reach an informed
          conclusion. The boundary isn't exactly a solid line, but intent and disclosure are key pieces.
